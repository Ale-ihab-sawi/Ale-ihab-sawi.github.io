    <h4> My name is Ihab Ahmed Saud. I am from Fallujah, Iraq. when I was 18 I left my country and went to Italy.</h4>
    <h4> In Italy I studied in <a href="http://www.uwcad.it/">the United World College of the Adriatic</a> which teach the IB and it was the most amazing and importing
     experience in my entire life.</h4>
     <h4> and since the teaching was in English, I had to learn English which was pretty awesome. at the same time I had to learn Italian as well</h4>
     <h4>two years after that I graduated from UWCAD with the IB and applied to Luther College.</h4>
    <h4> Now I am a full time student at Luther College and I am at the end of my Second year at Luther, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. </h4>
    <h4> I just started my journy in the Computer field this semester and this semester I took two CS classes: CS-130 and CS-150</h4>
    <h4> CS-130 is "Fundamentals of Web Programming" and in this course we don't have exam instead we have project to present.</h4>
    <h4> My first project is to make my own home page on the internet, and that is why I made this page and I will use every thing that</h4>
    <h4> I have learned in this classes to build this page and link all the other projects to it.</h4>
