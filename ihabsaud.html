    <h4> My name is Ihab Ahmed Saud and I am from Fallujah, Iraq. when I was 18 I left my country and went to Italy. In Italy I studied in <a href="http://www.uwcad.it/">the United World College of the Adriatic</a> which teachs IB (International Baccalaureate) and it 
    was the most amazing and importing experience in my entire life. Since the teaching was in English, I had to learn English which was pretty awesome. at the same time I had to learn Italian as well.Two years after that I graduated from UWCAD with the I.B. Certificate 
    and I applied to Luther College. Now I am a full time student at Luther College and I am at the end of my Second year, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science.I just started my journy in the Computer Science field this semester. As for this semester I taking two 
    CS classes: CS-130 and CS-150. CS-130 which is "Fundamentals of Web Programming" and in this course we don't have exams instead we have projects to present. then based on how good you did on your project.The teacher will evaluate you. My first project is to make my own
    home page on the internet, and that is why I made this page and I will use every thing that I have learned in this class to build this page and link all the other projects to it.</h4>
